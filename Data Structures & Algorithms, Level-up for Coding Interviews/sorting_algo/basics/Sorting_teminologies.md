# Sorting Terminoliges

### Types of Sorting:
* Internal Sorting
* External Sorting
* Stable Sorting
* Unstable Sorting

`Internal Sorting:`
* When all data is placed in the main memory or internal memory then sorting is called internal sorting.
* Example: heap sort, bubble sort, selection sort

`External Sorting:`
* When all data that needs to be sorted cannot be placed in memory at a time, the sorting is called external sorting. External Sorting is used for the massive amount of data. 
* Example: Merge sort, Tag sort, Polyphase sort

`Stable Sorting:`
* When two same data appear in the same order in sorted data without changing their position is called stable sort.
* Example: merge sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort.

`Unstable Sorting:`
* When two same data appear in the different order in sorted data it is called unstable sort.
* Example: quick sort, heap sort, shell sort.
